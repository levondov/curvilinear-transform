curvilinear-transform
=====================

2d curvilinear coordinate transformation

curvilinear-transform is a program that does a 2d curvilinear
coordinate transformation to a set of data points given a 'centerline' to
use as a reference for the transformation. The program is written in a
way to only work with custom data, but can easily be changed to work with
other data. There is also a built in GUI that displays the data pre and post
transformation. The program was originally written in matlab, but I have
rewritten it in python. Origin Matlab code is available upon request. 

Prerequesites needed to run Python 2.6 or higher (Has only been tested on Python 2.7+) The following python packages:
 'matplotlib', 'wxpython', 'numpy'
v1.1
- added color option for data points
- added option to show figures in 3d
